# Deployment Strategy

## Local/Development
- Use `docker-compose.yml` to spin up all services, databases, Kafka, and Redis locally.
- Hot-reload enabled for local development.

## Production
- Use Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestration:
  - Each service has its own Deployment, Service, and ConfigMap/Secret.
  - Use Ingress for API gateway and frontend routing.
  - Use StatefulSets for databases, Kafka, and Redis clusters.
  - Enable auto-scaling and self-healing.
- Use managed cloud services for DB, Kafka, and Redis if possible.

## CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar for automated build, test, and deploy.
- Build Docker images for each service and push to a container registry.
- Deploy to Kubernetes using manifests or Helm charts.
- Run integration and security tests as part of the pipeline.

## Secrets & Config
- Use Kubernetes Secrets or a secret manager for sensitive data.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
