# Scaling Strategy

## Frontend
- Deploy multiple instances of the React app behind a load balancer (e.g., NGINX, cloud LB).
- Serve static assets via CDN for global performance.

## API Gateway
- Run multiple instances for high availability and load balancing.
- Use NGINX or a cloud load balancer to distribute traffic.

## Microservices
- Each service is stateless and can be horizontally scaled (multiple containers/pods).
- Use orchestration (Kubernetes) to auto-scale based on CPU/memory or custom metrics.

## Databases
- Use managed databases with read replicas and automated failover.
- Partition data if needed (sharding for large scale).

## Kafka & Redis
- Deploy Kafka and Redis in clustered mode for high availability and throughput.

## Infrastructure
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration, auto-scaling, and self-healing.
- Monitor with Prometheus/Grafana and set up alerts for scaling events.
