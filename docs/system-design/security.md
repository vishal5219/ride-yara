# Security Best Practices

## API Gateway
- Enforce HTTPS for all incoming traffic.
- Centralized authentication (JWT, OAuth2) and authorization.
- Rate limiting and IP whitelisting.

## Microservices
- Validate JWT tokens on every request.
- Sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use HTTPS for all inter-service communication (mTLS if possible).
- Principle of least privilege for service-to-service access.

## Kafka & Redis
- Enable authentication and authorization.
- Use network policies/firewalls to restrict access.

## Databases
- Use strong credentials and rotate them regularly.
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

## Frontend
- Use HTTPS for all API calls.
- Secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
- Protect against XSS and CSRF.

## Secrets Management
- Store secrets in environment variables or secret managers (Kubernetes Secrets, Vault).

## Monitoring & Auditing
- Log all authentication and authorization events.
- Monitor for suspicious activity and set up alerts.
